## Nice to know

It is awesome when you write a better code even if it is a single line .

It's a moment that deserves to be proud of as a self-learning Developer.

**One of that moments in this project is this line of code that the instructor writes**

```javascript
data && data.error && data.error.message;
```

While I use my knowledge in **Optional Chaining**

```javascript
data?.error?.message;
```

Happy Coding 😍
